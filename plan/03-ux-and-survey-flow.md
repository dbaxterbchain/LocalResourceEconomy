# UX and Survey Flow

## Participant flow (mobile first)
1. Landing page with study name, survey name, host info, and consent text.
2. Cohort label shown if the survey link is tied to a cohort.
3. Contact info at start if required by survey settings.
4. Guided flow: one question per screen, section progress, and friendly hints.
5. Review and submit.
6. Contact info at end if configured for end collection.
7. Thank you screen with confirmation.

## Research team flow
1. Login.
2. Study hub: view study info and survey list.
   - Future: study picker or study list when multiple studies are enabled.
3. Create or edit survey: sections, questions, repeatable groups.
4. Create cohort (study run) and generate a survey link per cohort.
5. Configure contact info: optional or required, at start or end.
6. Open survey link for the cohort and share link or QR.
7. Monitor responses (filter by cohort), edit with reason, view audit log.
8. Export data (CSV or JSON).

## Conversational UX principles
- Short prompts and clear helper text.
- Large tap targets and one column layout.
- Smooth progress indicator to reduce drop off.
- Validation that allows free text for units and quantities.

## Accessibility and cross device
- Keyboard friendly on desktop.
- High contrast and readable font sizes.
- Forms work on phones and larger screens without layout breakage.
